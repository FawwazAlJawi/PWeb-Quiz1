    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p><a href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabupaten_Jombang">Jombang</a> is where I was born and raised, though I honestly have not yet explored Jombang thoroughly, safe to say I lived there long enough to tell you about them</p>
    <h2>What's in Jombang anyway?</h2>
    <h3>4<sup>th</sup> President of Indonesia</h3>
    <p><a href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdurrahman_Wahid">Abdurrahman Wahid</a>, also known as Gus Dur, as officially the fourth President of Indonesia. He was born and raised in Jombang, while it also become <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Sx2quPAA6CuR2x9A6">his final resting place</a></p>
    <h3>Pondok Pesantren (Ponpes)</h3>
    <p>There is somewhat popular topic that Jombang is burstling with Islamic Boarding Schools (Pondok Pesantren), and that is slightly untrue. There are merely <a href="https://jombangkab.bps.go.id/statictable/2018/05/23/234/data-pondok-pesantren-di-kab-jombang-2017.html">under a 100 Pondok Pesantren</a> (save small and minor Ponpes left unaccounted), in Jombang, is very little compared to those in Bogor or Tasikmalaya who had thousands. But what helps the reputation that it feature some of the more prominent Ponpes such as Tebuireng and Darul Ulum.</p>
